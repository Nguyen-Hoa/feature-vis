# Sampling the 'Inverse Set' of a Neuron: An Approach to Understanding Neural Nets by Hada and Carreira-Perpinan

This paper proposes an efficient method that finds good features for visualizing neurons. The features are fed into a generator network proposed by [Dosovitskiy et al](DeePSim.md) to generate, in image space, features that excite a neuron.
