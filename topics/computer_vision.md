### Frequency

The result of applying a Fourier transform to an image is a representation of the image in the frequency domain. With the center of the image representing the low frequency part (structural information), and the outer edges of the image representing the high frequency part (edges and details).

* A Gaussian filter is a low-pass filter, which when applied, leaves only the low frequency part of an image. This can give a smoothing effect.
