Organizing ideas related to understanding neural networks through feature visualization. Best viewed on [Github Pages](https://nguyen-hoa.github.io/feature-vis/).

- [Literature](literature/literature.md) for a list of readings toward understanding feature visualization.
- [Topics](topics/topics.md) contains resources for understanding subjects like optimizations and calculus.

Inspired by [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), open repository in Visual Studio Code to view graph of connecting topics.
