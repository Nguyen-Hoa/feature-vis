# Feature Visualization

Organizing ideas related to understanding neural networks through feature visualization.

- See [Literature](literature/) for a list of readings toward understanding feature visualization.
- [Topics](topics/) contains resources for understanding subjects like optimizations and calculus.

## Test Math

$$
x_{ij} = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & |\sum_{c}x \cdot \nabla_{x}a_{i}(x)| \leq {\theta}_{c\_pct} \\
            x_{ij}
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$
$\nabla_{x}a_{i}(x)$ this is an inline math.
